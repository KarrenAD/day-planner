Week Five Homework - Day Planner

ASSIGNMENT HIGHLIGHTS

- I STARTED THIS PROJECT BY USING MOMENTjs TO SET THE DATE
- THE DATE WAS THEN APPENDED TO THE PROPER DIV

- THE NEXT STEP WAS TO SET COLORS TO THE TIME FIELDS ACCORDING TO WHAT TIME IT WAS DURING THE DAY
    - I GRABBED ALL THE ELEMENTS WITH CLASS ROWS, AND WAS ABLE TO USE AN EACH LOOP TO GO THROUGH THE ARRAY AND CLEAR STYLING CLASSES AND USE CONDITIONALS TO CHECK TIME AND SET NEW STYLING ELEMENTS.

- LASTLY, I CREATED A CLICK EVENT THAT SAVED THE VALUE OF THE <TEXTAREA> TO LOCAL STORAGE
- I WAS THEN ABLE TO RECALL THE LOCAL STORAGE SO THAT THE VALUE OF THE <TEXTAREA> PERSISTED AFTER REFRESH

**KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS LESSON**
- I LEANED ON DATA ATTRIBUTES QUITE A BIT FOR THIS LESSON; FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS LESSON IT SEEMED LIKE THE BEST WAY TO REFER TO, GRAB, AND MANIPULATE THE SECTIONS OF MY HTML 

- THIS WAS ALSO MY FIRST TIME IN HOMEWORK USING AN EACH LOOP
